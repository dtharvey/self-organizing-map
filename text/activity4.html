<p>The last of a self-organizing map’s three phases is
<strong>adaptation</strong> in which the algorithm repeats itself over
multiple cycles of competition and cooperation. At each step, a node’s
new rgb value is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{rgb}_{new} = {rgb}_{old} + \eta \times
\theta \times ({rgb}_{train} - {rgb}_{old})\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> accounts for the
effect of step-size and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>
accounts for the BMU’s affect on its neighbors. The initial step-size,
<span class="math inline">\(\eta_{0}\)</span>, and the initial
radius,<span class="math inline">\({r}_{0}\)</span>, are chosen to
encourage rapid changes in the rgb values. Over time, both experience an
exponential decrease in value at each step, allowing for more precise
adjustments to the rgb values.</p>
<p>The figure on the right shows the initial grid used on the
competition and cooperation tab panels with sliders to set the initial
step-size, <span class="math inline">\(eta_{0}\)</span>, and the initial
radius, <span class="math inline">\(r_{0}\)</span>. The number of
iterations is set by the remaining slider. The grid below the sliders
shows its structure at the end of the iterations. A color swatch is
shown to the upper right of the grid. This is a new sample passed to the
trained grid; its location on the training grid is shown by the white
circle.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Leaving <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({r}_{0}\)</span> at their default values, examine
the trained grid after one iteration and after 25 iterations. You will
find it helpful to go back-and-forth between the limits on iterations.
In what ways are the trained grids similar to each other and in what
ways are they different from each other. <em>Note: There is a delay in
updating the grid as the number of iterations increases</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Leaving <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({r}_{0}\)</span> at their default values, examine
the trained grid as you step sequentially through all 25 iterations. How
does the number of iterations affect the ability of the self-organized
map to correctly predict the location of a new sample in the trained
grid?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Explore the effect of initial step-size
and initial radius on the trained grid. Are your results consistent with
what you saw on the cooperation tab panel?</p>
