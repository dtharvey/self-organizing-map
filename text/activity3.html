<p>Having identified the initial grid’s BMU as the node in the third row
and in the second column, the second phase of the self-organizing map’s
algorithm is to adjust the BMU’s rgb values so they are closer to those
of the training sample. We also adjust the rgb values for nodes in the
neighborhood of the BMU, with the size of the adjustment depending on
how close, in space, the node is to the BMU; this second step is
described as <strong>cooperation</strong> because the BMU influences the
rgb values of other nodes. Mathematically, we express this as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{rgb}_{new} = {rgb}_{old} +
\text{adjustment} \times  ({rgb}_{train} - {rgb}_{old})\]</span></p>
<p>There are two contributions to this adjustment: how close a node is
to the BMU in the grid and how much of the difference between the rgb
values of the training set and the grid is applied to the node. The two
sliders on the upper right account for these adjustments. The slider for
radius defines a circle centered on the BMU; only nodes inside the
circle have their rgb values adjusted. The slider for step-size defines
the fraction of <span class="math inline">\(({rgb}_{train} -
{rgb}_{old})\)</span> applied to a node. The upper figure is the
original, untrained grid with the BMU identified by the node with the
small white circle. The other figure shows each node’s new rgb values
(as color swatches) after applying the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Leave the radius at its default value of
5 and explore how a change in step-size affects the rgb values of the
grid’s nodes. Explain why your observations make sense for a step-size
of 0 and for a step-size of 1.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Leave the step-size at its default value
of 0.5 and explore how a change in radius affects the rgb values of the
grid’s nodes. Explain why your observations make sense for a radius of 1
and for a radius of 10.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. If you want to see a large change in the
rgb values of the grid’s nodes, should you favor a larger or a smaller
radius, and/or a larger or a smaller step-size?</p>
