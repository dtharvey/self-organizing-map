<h4>What is a Machine Learning Algorithm?</h4>
<p>Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses a
computer algorithm to search for an underlying structure in a set of
data. The algorithm learns by using a set of training samples to make
predictions about samples it has not yet seen. The figure on the upper
right provides a simple visual example of untrained and trained data in
which an initial grid of random colors becomes structured when training
is complete.</p>

<h4>What is Unsupervised Learning?</h4>
<p>Learning is unsupervised when we cannot assign meaningful labels to
the training data. In the rgb system a color is defined by three
integers between 0 and 255—one each for red, green, and blue—giving
<span class="math inline">\(256 \times 256 \times 256 = 1.7 \times
10^{7}\)</span> distinct colors. This is much more expansive than just
“red”, “green”, or “blue”. The algorithm learns by grouping together
samples whose rgb values are similar to each other without prior
knowledge of what the rgb values represent.</p>

<h4>How Does a Map Become Self-Organized?</h4>
<p>The figure on the bottom right illustrates a small portion of an SOM
in the form of a 2D grid of nodes, each with a random set of rgb values.
A sample from a training set is compared to every node in the grid and
the sample and node with the closest rgb values—called the best matching
unit (BMU) and shown here by the thickness of the line that connects
them—is used to adjust the rgb values of the grid’s nodes, giving
greater weight to those located near the BMU; this process of
competition (Which node is the BMU?), cooperation (Which nodes are near
the BMU and by how much should we adjust their rgb values?), and
adaptation (How should we extend this to additional training samples?)
is what it means for the initial grid to become self-organized.</p>
