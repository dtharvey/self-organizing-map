<h4>Reproducability of Self-Organizing Maps</h4>
<p>The figure on the right shows four self-organizing maps of the rgb
color system: each uses 100 iterations over a <span class="math inline">\(10 \times 10\)</span> grid; each uses the same
initial values for the step-size, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{0}\)</span>, and for the radius, <span class="math inline">\(r_{0}\)</span>; and each uses the same decay
constants of 100 for <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{0}\)</span> and
for <span class="math inline">\(r_{0}\)</span>. The initial rgb values
populating the <span class="math inline">\(10 \times 10\)</span> grid
and the training samples are drawn at random from the same population of
<span class="math inline">\(1.7 \times 10^{7}\)</span> unique sets of
rgb values; there is little likelihood, however, that any two maps are
built using the same random grid and the same set of training samples.
Note that an individual color does not map to the same absolute position
within the grid—red does not, in these four examples, own the
upper-right corner—it is the relative mapping—the proximity of reds
relative to blues and purples—that is meaningful and reproducible. Each
of these four maps will take a sample it has not yet seen and reasonably
locate its position within the trained grid.</p>

<h4>Additional Resources</h4>
<p>The treatment of self-organizing maps in this learning module is
intentionally limited, emphasizing a more general than technical
description of how an SOM algorithm works. The resources gathered here
provide a broader range of treatments. The second-to-last resource links
to the CRAN page for the <code>kohonen</code> package or R functions for
creating self-organizing maps. The final resource links to a nice
on-line article about the rgb color system.</p>
