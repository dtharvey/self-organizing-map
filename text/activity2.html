<p>The algorithm for a self-organizing map has three phases, the first
of which is a <strong>competition</strong> to identify which of the
grid’s nodes is closest to a sample drawn from the training set. This
competition is based on the distance, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, between their respective rgb
values</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = \sqrt{({red}_{node} -
{red}_{train})^2 + ({green}_{node} - {green}_{train})^2 + ({blue}_{node}
- {blue}_{train})^2)}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\({red}_{node}\)</span> is the node’s
value for red, <span class="math inline">\({red}_{train}\)</span> is the
training sample’s value for red, <span class="math inline">\({green}_{node}\)</span> is the node’s value for
green, <span class="math inline">\({green}_{train}\)</span> is the
training sample’s value for green, and <span class="math inline">\({blue}_{node}\)</span> is the node’s value for
blue, and <span class="math inline">\({blue}_{train}\)</span> is the
training sample’s value for blue. The shorter the distance, the closer
the rgb values are to each other. The node in the grid closest to the
training sample is the best matching unit, or BMU. The grid on the right
has 100 nodes selected at random from the population of <span class="math inline">\(1.7 \times 10^7\)</span> possible combinations of
rgb values. Individual nodes are defined by their position within the
grid using the row number (1 to 10 from bottom-to-top) and the column
number (1 to 10 from left-to-right); a small white circle shows the node
defined by the sliders. Information about the training sample is shown
below the grid as its set of rgb values, which are (182,14,90); a color
swatch provides a visual sense of the training sample’s color.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. The slider’s default position is [1,1],
using the format [row number, column number]. Use the rgb values for
[1,1] of (73,153,61) to verify that the distance between the training
sample and the node is 179.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong> Use the color swatches in the grid to
predict which of the nodes in the four corners of the grid—[1,1],
[1,10], [10,1], and [10,10]—is closest to the training sample and which
is furthest. Use the sliders to check your prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Which of the grid’s 100 nodes is closest
to the training sample? Use the color swatches for the grid’s nodes and
the training sample’s color swatch to help you narrow possibilities.</p>
