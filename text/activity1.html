<p>To understand how the algorithm for a self-organizing map uses rgb
values to train a grid of random samples, it is helpful to feel
comfortable with how rgb values work. The three sliders on the right set
the individual values for red, green, and blue. Each slider has a range
of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(255\)</span> and is set, initially, to its
mid-point value of 128. The square below each slider shows the rgb color
associated with that individual slider’s value; for example, the square
below the slider for red has rgb values of (128, 0, 0). The rectangle at
the bottom shows the result of adding together the three individual
colors: in this case the color has rgb values (128,128,128).</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Describe the individual colors for red,
green, and blue relative to your internal picture of what it means to be
red, green, and blue. For example, you might decide that a value of 128
for red is “dark red.” If you decrease each individual rgb value to 100,
to 50, and to 0, what affect does it have on the color? If you increase
each individual rgb value to 150, to 200, and to 255, what affect does
it have on the color? Can you write a simple rule that describes how a
color changes as you increase or decrease its individual rgb value?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Set each slider to a value of 100 and
describe their additive color, as seen in the rectangle. Repeat using
values of 150 and 200. Can you write a simple rule that describes how
the additive color changes when all three sliders are set to the same
rgb value?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Set two of the three sliders to rgb
values of 255 and set the remaining slider to a value of 0. Describe
what you see. Repeat using the other two possible combinations of rgb
values.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. If you are restricted to rgb values of
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(255\)</span>, how many distinct colors are there
and what names would you assign to them?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong>. Experiment with the three sliders and
see if you can find a combination that satisfies your sense of what it
means to be orange.</p>
