# self-organizing-map
This learning module introduces self-organizing maps as a means for finding an underlying structure in a set of data. The module uses rgb colors as a source of data. Beginning with a 10 Ã— 10 grid of random rgb colors, the user explores how a training set of rgb values allows the grid to recognize the color of new samples presented to it.
